The Tarasque is believed to be a minor skin parasite of this creature.\r\n\r\nFollowing the encounter, the Executive Committee determined that the immensity of Anteverse XLII's lifeforms represented unacceptable risks, and recommended dispatching Gatekeeper teams for retrieving any further research subjects or data in the future.",

Study has therefore been largely theoretical, and the cause of its incursion from Anteverse 299 remains uncertain \r\n\r\nHowever, the so-called 'Core' appears to cause fluctuations in perforation activity, and observers have suggested that it may have grounded some of the undirected, trans-anteversal force following a recent destabillization event. Whether this is responsible for its translocation into the GATE Cascade Research Facility or not may never be known with absolute certainty.\r\n\r\nThe object appears old, but has also sustained damage, presumably in the process of transferring from A299 to A0, leaving it in what can only be described as a hibernational state.
