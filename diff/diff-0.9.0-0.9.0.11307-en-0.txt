Euh..tu vas pas passer par le portail là?

I wouldn't blame you for trying your luck, but don't expect me to follow.

If I could only get to Reactors, there's equipment that could help. [5.8]But it may as well be on the moon right now.

If it's a choice between random portals [2.7]and risking my skin with whatever's lurking in Security Sector, [7.3]well, that's no choice at all. [9.8]I'm staying here.

Isaiah ... didn't make it.

That portal ... just appeared. [3.2]I've no idea how, but I am not going through! [7.9]Without the Dark Lens, it could land in the middle of a supernova for all we know!

You think Security Sector is any safer than this? [3.6]It's not just a rumor, staff have disappeared! [7.7]The Defense Team says there's nothing to worry about, [10.6]but that's when you know there's a problem.

You're not seriously thinking of going through ... [4.2]are you?

If there was anything more 'jugaad' than this field-fabricated, high-security instrusion device constructed on successive layers of equally improvised hackery, you'd like to see it.
